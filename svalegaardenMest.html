            <p>
                Svalegaarden Mest was my first exam project, 
                and was focused on creating a website that 
                lived up to the qualities presented by the 
                company. Currently they have a 2 in 1 website, 
                and our task was to create the B2C part of 
                the website, creating a more coherent site, 
                and reworking the design and information 
                architecture based on material received from 
                the company.

                This project was managed by first 
                making Work Breakdown structure, to 
                better get an overview of the 
                individual assignments in the 
                project. Thereafter I could arrange 
                the tasks in an order after their 
                dependencies, and place them in a 
                gantt-diagram, which can be seen 
                below.

                Information architecture
            </h2>
            <p class="p1">
                To figure out how to make the 
                information architecture best 
                manageable, I started off by 
                making a content inventory. This 
                way it was easier for me to get 
                an overview over what needed to 
                be changed, deleted or kept as 
                it was.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                From this we could make an interview 
                guide with questions relevant for 
                creating the website.

                User analysis
            </h2>
            <p class="p1">
                In order to get an idea of the 
                general target audience, a series 
                of user analysis was conducted. 
                First off i analysed the material 
                that we were given for the project, 
                since we didn't have a costumer 
                meeting. 
                <br><br>
                In the material was a strategic brief, 
                with a colorscheme, font styles, 
                pictures and a chart of qualities that 
                they wanted the website to communicate 
                to the costumers - these were mostly 
                focused on luxury and maturity.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                After analysing the interview, I could 
                see a series of patterns, revealing what 
                the costumers focused on; these involved 
                quality over price, wide selection of 
                food and manageable information. These 3 
                central themes would later help us build 
                the prototypes.
