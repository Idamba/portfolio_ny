                Englerod is an online recipe blog with plant 
                based food.

                <br>
                This project focused on a series of new things 
                that we had yet to try out - first of all, we 
                would have to choose between five planes of 
                UX and scrum for project management, instead 
                of just WBS and gantt-diagrams as previously. 
                We choose to work with scrum as seen further 
                down.
                <br>
                Other than that, we had to work with headless 
                CMS and API through Wordpress - this way we 
                should be able to sort and show posts that 
                were created through Wordpress.

                To start off this project I did a 
                categorization to get an idea of the 
                target audience. Here we found that 
                there was both a primary audience and 
                a secondary audience - the difference 
                between these two groups being primarily 
                their age.
                <br><br>
                After I found the target audience, we did 
                a series of interviews to learn more about 
                their motives and what they valued when 
                looking for recipes online. In these 
                interviews I could see a series of 
                repeating patterns amongst the interviewee's.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                These were: adjusting recipes to 
                allergies/taste, using the vegetables of 
                the season, interest in pictures and an 
                indicator of how much time the recipes 
                demands of you as well a difficulty.
                <br><br>
                After this, I did a competitor analysis to 
                get a better idea of what might be lacking 
                from the site. The sites we used to compare 
                were pickuplimes.com, miasommer.org as well 
                as deliciouslyella.com.

                For this project we worked with scrum for the 
                first time. I primarily worked on creating 
                the design for the website, which was created 
                mobile first. I wanted the website to have a 
                modern, simplistic and sleek look.
