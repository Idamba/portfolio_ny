                Nordsjællands Kattehjælp
            </h1>
    
            <p>
                Nordsjællands Kattehjælp is a network of 
                volunteers who strive to help stray cats 
                in Denmark. They both help stray cats 
                into new families, as well as neutralise 
                strays and release them back into the 
                streets. The project was made for my 
                second semester exam.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this project we decided to work with 
                scrum to become further acquainted with it, 
                and hopefully learn more about it along 
                the way. 
                <br>
                This costumers allowed us to work with 
                headless CMS and API through wordpress once 
                again, and as seen further down we 
                successfully executed this.

               User analysis 
            </h2>
            <p class="p1">
                As usual I started off with a categorization 
                to find out the target audience. Here it 
                became evident that we had two separate target 
                audiences, since the website would be used both 
                by visitors interested in adopting, as well as 
                visitors who had a cat in need of help, and 
                needed information about what to do.
                <br><br>
                Other than that the target audience would be 
                from Zealand and above 18, as these are demands 
                stated by the organization.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                From this categorization we did 5 interviews, 
                where we learned the following: It's important 
                for visitors interested in adopting to know 
                about the organization and the people behind 
                it, just as much as it is important for them 
                to get information about the cats.
                Another thing mentioned was how it should be 
                quick and easy to donate.
                <br><br>
                After this we did a competitor analysis to get 
                an overview over what the site might be lacking. 
                We used kattens-vaern.dk and foreningensimba.dk 
                for this.

                Scrum
            </h2>
            <p class="p1">
                In this project we worked with scrum once again.
                I first established the information architecture by doing a card sorting to get an idea of the users mental model.
                <br><br>
                Other than that I worked quite a bit with the design of the website, mainly focusing on optimizing UI from the first prototypes that were created by another group member. Here I made use of basic design principles, such as the gestalt principles and Dan Browns eight principles of information architecture.
                <br><br>
                Below you can see some before and afters of the optimized designs.
