        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio! My name is 
            Ida-Marie, and I'm a 22 year old woman studying multimedia design. 
            Ever since I was a child I've been an unique and creative soul, 
            always seeking out new experiences due to my curious nature.
            <br>

        <h2 class="redHeader">
            Professional life
        </h2>
        <p>
            In my professional life I'd like to see myself working as an UX/UI 
            designer, but I also have an interest in frontend development, and 
            wouldn't mind working a bit with that as well.
            <br>
            Through my education at UCN I have learned to work in all areas of 
            multimedia design ranging from project management, user analysis, 
            UX design, UI design, coding, photography and more. Other than that 
            I have basic skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as Adobe 
            programs such as Adobe XD, lightroom, photoshop and illustrator.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm fluent in Danish and English.
            <br>

        <h2 class="redHeader">
            Personal life
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a person I'm a proper geek who enjoys videogames, anime and 
            everything in between. In my free time I'm a cosplayer, which 
            for me means I'm very creative in general and love trying out 
            new techniques and testing new theories in all aspects in life. 
            I'm also an educated nail technician, which adds further to my 
            creative and experimentalist soul.
            <br>
            <br>
            On top of that I'm a very social person, and love interacting 
            with all kinds of people in all aspects of life.

            User analysis
        </h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my education I have 
            worked with interviews, 
            categorization, user tests and 
            more. These are used to 
            thoroughly examine who the 
            target audience should be, and 
            how I can best accommodate 
            them.

            Project management
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another thing that UCN has taught 
            me is how to use project management 
            for all kinds of projects. I always 
            make use of WBS, Gantt-diagrams, 
            prototyping, scrum and more, depending 
            on the size of the project.

        <p>
            When I develop a website I always 
            keep the users needs and interaction 
            patterns in mind. I have lots of 
            experience from my education working 
            with the users expectations in mind.
