        </h1>

        <p>
            This was my very first project, and was aimed towards 
            creating a microsite for Jul I Zoo that can inform 
            and promote the event to the target audience. The 
            website is made mobile first.
            <br>
            Jul I Zoo is an event for mostly families that 
            celebrates Christmas with events, activities etc.  
        </p>

        <p class="casesUse">
            You can use the tabs below to see the different steps 
            i had a part to play in.

    <div class="tabs">
        <button class="bebasNeue tabHover tab" onclick="openTab(event, 'projectManagementJulIZoo')">

        <p class="p1">
            This was my first time working with 
            project management, and me and my team 
            all decided that the best way to 
            approach was to use Work Breakdown 
            Structure to break down the whole 
            project into simple tasks. The tasks 
            were all estimated in days, if they 
            had any dependencies, and when we 
            would be able to begin them.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            Thereafter they were placed into a 
            Gantt-diagram which gave us a better 
            overview of the project. This way we 
            could always keep track of our process 
            throughout the project, and if we were 
            falling behind.

        <h2 class="redHeader">
            Information architecture
        </h2>
        <p class="p1">
            A part of the assignment was also to 
            rearrange the information architecture 
            on the page. This meant that i had to 
            create a content inventory first - this 
            content inventory was based on our user 
            analysis. 
            <br><br>
            Since a lot of our interviewee's focused 
            on the need to see which events would be 
            at Jul I Zoo we made a whole page just for 
            this called events, which wasn't originally 
            on the page.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            Most of the interviewee's also mentioned 
            that they were worried about the covid-19 
            situation. Therefore we made a page with 
            information about precautions and how the 
            Zoo put the costumers' safety first. 
            <br><br>
            Below you can see the content inventory.

            Prototyping
        </h2>
        <p class="p1">
            After i established the information 
            architecture and the users' wants and 
            needs through the user analysis, the 
            prototyping phase begun.
            <br><br>
            The first iteration was drawn on paper 
            to get a general idea of the placements 
            and overall design.
            <br><br>
            The second iteration was made in adobe 
            XD. Here i decided on an analog color 
            palette that had colors the general 
            public would consider Christmas colors; 
            gold and red. We decided on this color 
            palette based on our user analysis.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            After the second iteration I did a think 
            aloud test, to make sure the visitors 
            attention and first impression were as 
            desired. From this I made our third iteration.
            <br><br>
            The response from the test told us that 
            the colorscheme and overall design was 
            too boring, and for some of the interviewee's 
            it felt more like a word document than a 
            website. Therefore I changed the design and 
            colorscheme quite a lot, and made smaller 
            adjustments such as font sizes, moving around 
            social media links etc.
