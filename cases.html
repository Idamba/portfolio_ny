                In this project we decided to work with scrum to become further acquainted with it, and hopefully learn more about it along the way. 
                <br><br>
                This project allowed us to work with headless CMS and API through wordpress once again, and as seen further down we successfully executed this.

                This project focused on a series of new things that we had yet to try out - first of all, we would have to choose between five planes of UX and scrum for project management, instead of just WBS and gantt-diagrams as previously. We choose to work with scrum as seen further down.

                Svalegaarden Mest was my first exam project, and was focused on creating a website that lived up to the qualities presented by the company. Currently they have a 2 in 1 website, and our task was to create the B2C part of the website, creating a more coherent site, and reworking the design and information architecture based on material received from the company.
